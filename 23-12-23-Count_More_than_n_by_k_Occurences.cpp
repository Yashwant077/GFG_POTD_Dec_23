/*
Problem Description: Count More than n/k Occurences

Given an array arr of size N and an element k. The task is to find the count of elements in the array that appear more than n/k times.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 8
arr = [3,1,2,2,1,2,3,3]
k = 4
Output: 
2
Explanation: 
In the given array, 3 and 2 are the only elements that appears more than n/k times.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 4
arr = [2,3,3,2]
k = 3
Output: 
2
Explanation: In the given array, 3 and 2 are the only elements that appears more than n/k times. So the count of elements are 2.
Your Task:
The task is to complete the function countOccurence() which returns count of elements with more than n/k times appearance.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= a[i] <= 10^9
1 <= k <= N
